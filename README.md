### Hello World! ðŸ‘€

Hey there, I'm Swathi!  Master's student by day, coding wizard by night ðŸŒ™. Currently, I'm diving deep into the world of data science at the University of Sheffield. I'm all about strengthening my Python, SQL, and R skills while also exploring my passion in gaming through code.

Join me on this wild journey from data to games and everything in between. I'm starting from scratch and building my way up, so expect some fun and maybe a few bugs along the way! ðŸ˜„ âœ¨
